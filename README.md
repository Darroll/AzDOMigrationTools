This is a work in progress. There are a lot of items that still need attention.

1. There are a lot of tests that fail as they require access to a site that most people do not have access to. These should be removed.
2. There are templates that should be removed.
3. There needs to be some general cleanup of unused code.
4. Code refactoring and cleanup still needs to happen.
