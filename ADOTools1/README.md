# Azure DevOps Migration Tools / DevOps ABCs Fork

The Azure DevOps Migration Tools allow you to bulk edit and migrate data between Team Projects on both Microsoft Azure DevOps Server (formely known as Microsoft Team Foundation Server or TFS) and Azure DevOps Services. This project is a fork of the original project published as [code on GitHub](https://github.com/nkdAgility/azure-devops-migration-tools/).

## What can you do with this tool?

- Assist in Bulk Editing of Work Items
- Migrate Work Items & Test Management from one Team Project to another
- Merge Team Projects
- Migrate Work Items & Test Management from one account or collection to another
- Assist in changing process templates

There are many other uses that you might put the tools to but migrating your entire Azure DevOps Server Collection to Azure DevOps Services is not one of them. You should also consider the [Azure DevOps Migration Service](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/migrate-tfs-vsts/) from Microsoft.
